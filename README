** It takes about 3 - 5 minutes to finish running the whole project **

1. extract the .zip file 
	unzip pp2.zip

2. cd to the project directory
	cd BayesianLinearRegressoin/

3. run the .jar file
	java -jar pp2.jar

If you need to look at the code, just cd to the code directory 
	cd src/pp2

If you need to check the raw data I got from the project, just cd to the results directory
	cd results

In the results directory, it contains the raw data for task 1 and task 2.
Results for task 1 are stored as mse_"test dataset"
	The first column is lambda
	The second column is mse for training set
	The third column is mse for test set
	The fourth column is the true mse
Results for task 2 are stored as learning_curve_"lambda value"_1000_100

optimal results for task 1, task 3 and 4 would be printed in console.
